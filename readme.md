# CPU by RISC-V

"Computer Composition and Design" experimental course project, CPU based on RISC-V architecture.

While working on the project completely and independently has been a great help in understanding the course, using github to help yourself is also an option.  

This is the reward for learning to use github, I hope you can inherit the open source spirit, we all stand on the shoulders of giants.  

The computer is a free and boundless field.  

Good luck.
